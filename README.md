#Installation Instructions

- Make sure you've brew package manager installed in your system. In case you don't have brew installed, you can install it by running following command on terminal
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
-  Now run "brew install node"
- Sit back and wait. Homebrew downloads some files and installs them. And that’s it.
 -To make sure you have Node and NPM installed, run two simple commands to see what version of each is installed:

To see if Node is installed, type node -v in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this v0.10.31.
To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.27
